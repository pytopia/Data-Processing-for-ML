    "2. The rules of broadcasting include:\n",
    "   - If the arrays have different numbers of dimensions, the shape of the array with fewer dimensions is padded with ones on its left side.\n",
    "   - If the size of any dimension is 1, that dimension can be stretched to match the size of the corresponding dimension in the other array.\n",
    "   - If the arrays have the same number of dimensions and the size of any dimension is not equal, that dimension must be 1 in one of the arrays.\n",
    "3. Broadcasting enables efficient memory usage by avoiding the creation of intermediate arrays and allows for concise and readable code.\n",
    "4. Examples of broadcasting include scalar and array broadcasting, one-dimensional array broadcasting, and multi-dimensional array broadcasting.\n",
    "5. Broadcasting offers advantages such as memory efficiency and concise code, but it also has limitations when dealing with incompatible array shapes and can lead to unintended consequences if not used carefully.\n",
    "6. Advanced broadcasting techniques, such as broadcasting with multiple arrays and broadcasting in user-defined functions, provide further flexibility and reusability in NumPy code.\n"

    "Broadcasting is a fundamental concept in NumPy that plays a crucial role in efficient and concise array operations. Its importance lies in several aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Efficiency**: Broadcasting eliminates the need for explicit loops and enables element-wise operations on arrays of different shapes. This leads to faster execution and improved performance, especially when working with large arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Memory Conservation**: By avoiding the creation of intermediate arrays, broadcasting reduces memory usage and overhead. This is particularly beneficial when dealing with large datasets or when memory resources are limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Concise and Readable Code**: Broadcasting allows you to express array operations in a more concise and intuitive manner. It eliminates the need for manual reshaping or explicit loops, resulting in cleaner and more readable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Flexibility**: Broadcasting enables you to perform operations on arrays with different shapes seamlessly. It provides a flexible and powerful way to combine and manipulate arrays, making it easier to work with complex data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Reusability**: By leveraging broadcasting in user-defined functions, you can create more versatile and reusable code. Functions designed with broadcasting in mind can handle inputs of different shapes, making them more generic and applicable to a wider range of scenarios.\n"
